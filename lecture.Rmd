# Goals

- In the last three weeks, we have discussed a lot of new ideas/concepts.
- This week, I want to slow down and spend some time discussing what we've learned and why.
- Data visualization: ggplot
    - `ggplot(foo, aes(x = bar, y = baz)) +`
    - `geom_point()`
- Data transformation: dplyr
    - `filter()`
    - `group_by()`
    - `summarize()` | `count()`
    - `arrange`
- New ideas for tonight:
    - Create new columns: `mutate()`
    - Linear Regression and t-tests
    - Honestly, mostly review.

# Hans Rosling

If you've never heard of Hans Rosling, let me immediately correct that educational oversight. He recorded a number of terrific videos before passing in 2017. This video, which is only four minutes, is one of his best. The easiest way to view this video is to hit the `Preview` button at the top of the editor. This will render this notebook as an HTML file and will embed the YouTube video in-line.

```{r fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("includes/preview.png")
```

# Setup

Run the code-chunk below to load everything you need for tonight's lecture.

```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)

## Disables scientific notation.
options(scipen = 999)

## This is a subset of the data from the gapminder presentation above.
gapminder <- read_csv("data/gapminder.csv")
```

# Gapminder Data

```{r}
gapminder
```

# Distinct!!!

Sometimes, we want to know the distinct values of a column.

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  select(continent) %>%
  distinct()
```

**Note:** Antarctica isn't on our list and North and South America are squished together. ðŸ¤· So, what do these new functions do?

- `select()` chooses which columns to keep.
    - This can also be used to drop columns and rearrange columns.
- `distinct()` returns the unique values in the _rows_ of the table.
    - UNIQUE ROWS!
    - This is SIMILAR to . . . .

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  count()
```

- These two code chunks are similar in terms of complexity.
- However, the results are slightly different.

## YOUR TURN

What is the distinct list of countries from Oceania?

```{r}
## YOUR CODE HERE!

```

Ha! The list of commands is longer than the list of countries.


## YOUR TURN

What is the first/last year per continent in this data set?

```{r}
## YOUR CODE HERE!

```

# Summarize

How many people lived in each continent in 2007?

- Create a new tibble called `cnt07` to hold this new data.
- Create a column called `tot_pop` to hold you summary statistic.

```{r}
## YOUR CODE HERE!
cnt07 <-
  gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(tot_pop = sum(pop)) ## NOTE: You can spell this either way.
cnt07
```

- PLEASE NOTICE WE CHANGED THE GRAIN OF THE DATA.
    - From: country/year
    - To: continent/population
- ðŸ˜³ ðŸ˜² ðŸ˜±

## YOUR TURN

Can you draw a bar plot of this data?

```{r}
## YOUR CODE HERE!

```

## Your Turn

Can you calculate the average life expectancy, by country, in the "Americas" continent prior to 1980?

```{r}
## YOUR CODE HERE!

```


## YOUR TURN

The gapminder data set contains country-grain data from 1952 to 2007. Which year has the highest number of countries? What about the lowest?

- I'm asking you to group by year and count the number of countries in the that given year.
- This is another change to change the grain of the data.

```{r}
## YOUR CODE HERE!

```


## YOUR TURN

What country had the highest life expectancy in the 1990's?

- This would include the 1992 and 1997 data.
- You can do this with the coding you know, but it is also a nice way to introduce `between()`.

```{r}
## YOUR CODE HERE!

```



# Mutate

- Teenage Mutant Ninja Columns . . . . 
- `mutate()` creates NEW columns from our existing data
- Unbelievably useful!

For example, we can add a percent column to `cnt07`

```{r}
cnt07 <-
  cnt07 %>%
  mutate(prc_pop = 100 * tot_pop / sum(tot_pop))
cnt07
```

You can also use mutate to create new groupings:

```{r}
nato_members <- c(
  "Albania", "Belgium", "Bulgaria", "Canada", "Croatia",
  "Czech Republic", "Denmark", "Estonia", "France", "Germany",
  "Greece", "Hungary", "Iceland", "Italy", "Latvia",
  "Lithuania", "Luxembourg", "Montenegro", "Netherlands",
  "North Macedonia", "Norway", "Poland", "Portugal", "Romania",
  "Slovak Republic", "Slovenia", "Spain", "Turkey",
  "United Kingdom", "United States"
)
gapminder <-
  gapminder %>%
  mutate(nato = if_else(country %in% nato_members, TRUE, FALSE))

gapminder %>%
  filter(nato) %>%
  select(country) %>%
  distinct()
```
Our data lacks data for Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, North Macedonia.

## And You Can Combine These!

Can you create a scatter plot showing the relationship between GDP Per Capita and Life Expectancy for NATO members in 1992?

```{r}
## YOUR CODE HERE

```


# Some Modeling

It  might be nice to better understand the relationship between these two variables.

- GDP Per Capita will be treated as our independent variable (X-Axis)
- Life Expectancy will be treated as our dependent variable (Y-Axis)
- We will use ALL gapminder countries, not just those from Nato.

```{r}
lm_model <-
  gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1992) %>%
  lm(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, data = .)
summary(lm_model)

gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1992) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop, color = country)) +
  geom_point(show.legend = FALSE) +
  theme() +
  theme_bw()
```

- The "linear" regression summary looks good.
- But . . . it isn't.
    - Our p-value is less than .05.
    - But we are explaining less than 50% of the variation in the data.
    - Something is not right here.
- The relationship is bent!
- [Wikipedia Anscombe's Quartet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet)

```{r}
gapminder <-
  gapminder %>%
  mutate(logLifeExp = log(lifeExp), logGdpPercap = log(gdpPercap))

lm_model <-
  gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1992) %>%
  lm(logLifeExp ~ logGdpPercap, data = .)
summary(lm_model)

gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1992) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = logGdpPercap, y = logLifeExp, size = pop, color = country)) +
  geom_point(show.legend = FALSE) +
  theme() +
  theme_bw()
```

That's better.
